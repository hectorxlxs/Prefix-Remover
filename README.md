# Prefix Remover
A little program, written in C++, that modifies filenames to delete a prefix that user inputs.

I have made this program because I use to save all my phone pictures into a local server at home, so I want the files to be arranged automatically from older to newer (that is what happens by default at least on Android devices because the files are named as date.jpg). And for example, WhatsApp pictures that I want to save into my server have the prefix IMG_ before the name of the picture file, so I remove it with this little program.

## "Installing" the program step by step
1. Install C++ compiler (I used MinGW version 5.3.0).
2. Download the .cpp file.
3. Open Windows terminal and go to the .cpp location.
4. Write on terminal "g++ filename.cpp"
5. Then, execute the a.exe that has been created.
6. A file named names.txt has been created on .cpp file location. You can remove it if you want.
